## What is the "Street Cleaner"?
Simutrans often builds a "roundabout hell". It is easiest explained with the following pictures:

As you can see, most of the "roundabouts/double roads" were removed, and this is what the "street cleaner" does.
It is not perfect and it will not remove every occurance of it, but it definitely helps.

It will only remove roads from the "public player". Any roads placed by the player will not be touched.
  
As some players might not want this, it is entirely optional and by default disabled.
You can enable it in the mission summary by clicking the "Activate" link.
