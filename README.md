## What is the "Street Cleaner"?
Simutrans often builds a "round-about hell". It is easiest explained with the following pictures:

As you can see the, most of the double roads were removed, and this is what the "street cleaner" does.
It is not perfect and it will not remove every occurance of it, but it definitely helps.

As some players might not want this, or due to some bugs, it might remove the "wrong" road, this is entirely optional and by default disabled.
You can enable it in the mission summary by clicking the "Activate" link.
